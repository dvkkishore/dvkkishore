Hi, I’m Kishore 👋  

I’m a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence for Industrial Applications at OTH Amberg-Weiden, Germany.

I enjoy working on **problem-solving applications and systems**, especially where software, design, and intelligent technologies come together to improve real-world workflows.

### What I’m currently working on
- Personal projects focused on building thoughtful, user-centric software systems
- Academic projects spanning software development, AI, and robotics

### Areas I actively work in
- UI/UX Design
- Web Development
- Mobile Application Development
- Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence
- Robotics (academic exposure and projects)

### Areas I’m exploring out of interest
- Game Development
- 3D design and mechanical modeling using SolidWorks

### How I approach building things
I like to understand both the **capabilities and limitations** of the technologies I use. I rely on structured problem-solving, experimentation, and iteration, and I use modern AI tools responsibly while maintaining full control over design and implementation decisions.

I’m continuously learning and exploring how different domains intersect to build meaningful and reliable systems.
